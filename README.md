### Description.
Mentor Bridge is an institution of change dedicated to providing every individual with the support necessary to thrive in the business world. We believe that small businesses are the backbone of economic prosperity and that an individual's success creates a ripple effect of growth for the entire community.

### Our Core Values
Our foundation is built on five pillars that transform raw ideas into thriving enterprises:

#### Innovation
"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower." — Steve Jobs We encourage our members to think differently and lead their industries through creative problem-solving.

#### Persistence
"Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." — Winston Churchill We believe resilience is the key to longevity. We provide the support needed to keep moving forward, no matter the obstacle.

#### Strategy
"Embrace what you don't know, especially in the beginning, because what you don't know can become your greatest asset." — Sara Blakely We help entrepreneurs turn uncertainty into a competitive advantage through smart, adaptable planning.

#### Mindset
"Don't let the fear of losing be greater than the excitement of winning." — Robert Kiyosaki Success starts between the ears. We foster a culture of boldness and calculated risk-taking.

#### Execution
"The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing." — Walt Disney Ideas are just the beginning. We emphasize taking decisive action to turn visions into reality.
